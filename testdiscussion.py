# Dictionaries
# Basic: Create a dictionary with three key-value pairs representing a student's information: name, age, and grade. Print each key-value pair on a new line.

    "name":"Ampurire",
    "age":22,
    "grade":"A"}

    return [name for name, age in people.items() if age >= 21]

# Example
people = {'Alice': 24, 'Bob': 19, 'Charlie': 30}

print(adult_names)  #  ['Alice', 'Charlie']

# Advanced: Given a dictionary representing items in a store with their prices, {'apple': 0.5, 'banana': 0.3, 'orange': 0.7}, write a program that takes a list of items bought, ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'banana'], and calculates the total cost.

# Challenge: Write a program that counts the occurrences of each word in a given sentence. Example: for the sentence "hello world hello," the output should be {'hello': 2, 'world': 1}.
def count_words(sentence):

# Challenge: Implement a class called Library that manages a collection of books. Each book has a title, author, and available status. The Library class should have methods to:
# Add a book to the library.
